# POO - Fitness and Training Management System

## Description
The Fitness and Training Management System is a project developed for the **Programa√ß√£o Orientada aos Objetos (POO)** course. The system enables users to manage fitness activities and training plans, track progress, and analyze performance data. It supports multiple types of physical activities and user profiles, allowing for realistic simulations of workout plans.

### üéØ Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including:
- Encapsulation and modularization
- Data modeling for users and activities
- Simulation of time-based training schedules
- Persistence of application state
- Development tools and debugging practices

### üöÄ Key Features:
- **Activity Tracking**: Record and manage various physical activities (e.g., running, cycling, weightlifting).
- **Training Plans**: Design and execute personalized training plans.
- **Performance Statistics**: Generate insights on calories burned, distance covered, and elevation gained.
- **Time Simulation**: Advance time to reflect scheduled workouts.
- **Persistence**: Save and load application state for continuity.
- **Hard Activity Classification**: Support for more intensive exercises with specific scheduling constraints.
- **Automated Plan Generation**: Create training plans based on user goals and constraints.

## üìö Learning Outcomes
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implemented encapsulated, modular, and extensible software components.
- **Class Design**: Developed a structured hierarchy of entities representing users, activities, and training plans.
- **Git & GitHub**: Used for version control and collaborative development.
- **Performance Analysis**: Measured user progress through recorded activities.

## üöß Areas for Improvement
- **Encapsulation and modularization**: There were some cases where we should have been more cautious with composition and aggregation.
- **Work distribution and time managment**: Although the backend is fully functional, the GUI was not fully implemented, making some features impossible to showcase, having a major impact in final grade. 
- **Enhanced Scheduling**: Introduce more flexible scheduling options for training plans.
